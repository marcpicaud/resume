# Resume [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/marcpicaud/resume.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/marcpicaud/resume)

This repository contains my resume based on the [resume-schema](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema) specification.

It is available at [https://marcpicaud.dev](https://marcpicaud.dev).

## How it works

Any push to the master branch will trigger a build on Travis, based on the resume.json file. If successful, the build artifact will then be pushed to the gh-pages branch, and served from GitHub Pages.

## PDF export

You can print the page and/or download it as PDF, it should render nicely.
